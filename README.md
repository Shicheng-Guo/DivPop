This study used the MESA cohort individuals with genotype and expression data to generate cis-eQTLs and multi-ethnic predictors of gene expression and show that training set with ancestry similar to the test set is better at predicting gene expression in test populations, emphasizing the need for diverse population sampling in genomics. 
#### MESA models are avaliable for download at [PredictDB](http://predictdb.org/) for use with PrediXcan and S-Predixcan.
- On the [PredictDB](http://predictdb.org/) page, click on `contributed/`. These models are filtered by `zscore_pval` < 0.05 and `rho_avg` > 0.1, see [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/predictdb2/GTEx-V7_HapMap-2017-11-29_README.txt) for explanation of performance statistics. 
- Unfiltered models are in the `unfiltered_dbs/` directory above
