This study used the MESA cohort individuals with genotype and expression data to generate cis-eQTLs and multi-ethnic predictors of gene expression that can be used with PrediXcan and S-predixcan. 
##### MESA models AFA, HIS, CAU, AFHI, and ALL are avaliable for download [here](http://predictdb.org).
##### cis-eQTL summary statistics for AFA, HIS, and CAU can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f6un5evevyvvyl9/AAA3sfa1DgqY67tx4q36P341a?dl=0) avaliable for download.
