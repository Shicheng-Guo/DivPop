This study used the MESA cohort individuals with genotype and expression data to generate cis-eQTLs and multi-ethnic predictors of gene expression and show that training set with ancestry similar to the test set is better at predicting gene expression in test populations, emphasizing the need for diverse population sampling in genomics. 
##### MESA [models](http://predictdb.org) AFA, HIS, CAU, AFHI, and ALL are avaliable for download and used with PrediXcan and S-predixcan.
##### cis-eQTL summary statistics for AFA, HIS, and CAU can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f6un5evevyvvyl9/AAA3sfa1DgqY67tx4q36P341a?dl=0).
##### The [BioArxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/10/245761.article-metrics) pre-print is avaliable discribing this study in detail.
